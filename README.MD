## Inspiration

As an avid foodie who loves to cook, I’ve often faced the challenge of not knowing what to cook based on the ingredients I have in my pantry. This has led to overspending and food wastage. I wanted a solution that not only helps in meal planning but also makes the cooking experience more enjoyable and efficient. Inspired by the idea of bringing people together through food and solving common kitchen challenges, I set out to create a platform that combines pantry management with recipe discovery and AI assistance.

## About the Project

**RecipeRack** is a comprehensive platform designed to address common kitchen challenges and enhance the cooking experience. Developed during a 24-hour hackathon, RecipeRack integrates several features into a single tool to manage your pantry, discover recipes, and connect with a community of food enthusiasts. Here’s what makes RecipeRack stand out:

### Key Features

## Development

**RecipeRack** is powered by a robust tech stack designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience:

- **Frontend:** Built with Streamlit, a Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications. Streamlit’s ease of use and focus on data apps allowed for rapid development and deployment.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Python for its simplicity and power in handling data and application logic. Streamlit's components were used to display data and manage interactions.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI tools, fine-tuned for our specific use case, were employed to generate recipe suggestions based on user inputs. Additionally, LangChain was used to facilitate interaction between the AI and the backend, ensuring smooth and dynamic responses.
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas was used for data analysis, providing powerful tools for manipulating and analyzing pantry data. Interactive charts and visualizations were created using Streamlit components to help users track their consumption habits and pantry status effectively.
